# Data Encryption Standard
This is a Python implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm.

## Execution
This basic implementation of DES takes in an ASCII string of any length and outputs 64-bit ciphertext blocks for each 64 bits of plaintext.
To run the program, simply use the command
`python des.py` (Note: May need to say `python3`, depending on your path variable. Program works with Python3 compiler only)

Once this command is run, you will be prompted to type in your ASCII string. After typing it in, press "Enter", and the program will encode the plaintext and output the ciphertext blocks to you

Enjoy!
