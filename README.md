# Cryptographic Algorithms

## Description
This project contains a various Cryptographic functions, created in
common programming languages, that can be compiled and run. Useful for anyone interested in learning more about the algorithms and being able to see everything they do behind-the-scenes.

DES is fully structured after the original algorithm. RSA and Exponential El Gamal use the correct key sizes, but include sample tests that wouldn't actually be the proper usage in a real, secure environment. Caesar Cipher was just a fun one I made when I first began learning about Cryptography.
